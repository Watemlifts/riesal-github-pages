In 2008 a boy called Joseph Schooling from Singapore has taken the above picture with the legendary Olympic champ Michael Phelps because he loved him and wanted to be like him.

8 years later and today Schooling has competed in the finals of 100 m butterfly swimming in Rio. He beat Phelps, broke his Olympic record and won the gold medal. Thanks to Mr. Phelps aka. the Baltimore Bullet for inspiring swimmers and athletes from all over the world. and big thanks to Mr. Schooling for giving us another living example that dreams do come true with dedication and hard work!!
