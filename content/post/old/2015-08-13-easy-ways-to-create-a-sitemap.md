### What is a sitemap?

A sitemap is a document that lists all URLs of your website that you would like crawled by a search engine. Most often, this document gives additional details such as the date a page was last modified, how frequently a page may change, and whether the page should be given priority over others, I will show you all the easy ways to create a sitemap..

### Why do I need a sitemap?

We’ve all become accustomed to using a search engine, probably daily. We often “Google” our questions throughout the day. Sitemaps are important because they tell search engines what pages are available for crawling on the website. They help search engines navigate your website and with this, your content is indexed.

Think of it this way, your website is a building, and the sitemap is the blueprint that explains where all the parts of the structure are. An important addition to any site, they are easy to create and once they are set up, do not require a lot of maintenance.

### How do the search engines find the sitemap?

Once your sitemap is set up, search engines don’t automatically find it. To have your site indexed, a submittal process is required. The process is easy, and this can be accomplished in just a few simple steps. There are others, but the two major search engines to start with are Google and Bing. Easy ways to create a sitemap, once you have your sitemap ready, you can do this by setting up a <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" target="_blank">Google Webmaster Tools</a> and a <a href="http://www.bing.com/toolbox/webmaster" target="_blank">Bing Webmaster Tools</a> account. After the accounts are setup, you will be able to walk through step by step to get your sitemap submitted.
